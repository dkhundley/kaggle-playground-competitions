Python version: 3.12

When working with any Python DataFrame, the preference is to use `polars` over `pandas` unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Ensure all annotated comments begin with a verb that ends in "ing" (e.g., "Adding", "Removing", "Calculating").

Please place a space before and after all operators (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, `==`, etc.) to enhance readability.
